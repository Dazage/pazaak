# Winning the game
There are 3-4 ways to win the set:

By outscore: After both players choose to stand, the player with the score closest to but not over 20 wins.

By going bust: If a player ends his turn with a score over 20, he is said to "bust," and the other player wins.

By filling the table: In some rare occasions, if a player places 9 cards on the table without busting, the player would automatically win, if his/her score ended up being 20 or under.

(Optional) By using the tiebreaker card: A golden tiebreaker card, when used last, brought victory to the user if both players had the same score.


When a set is tied, no one gets a point for the set, and a new set is played. The first player to win three sets wins the game.
